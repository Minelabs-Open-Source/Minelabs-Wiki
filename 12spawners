# 🐷 Spawners  

Turn mobs into endless resources with the power of spawners!  

✨ **How to Use**  
- Earn spawners through **grinding, crates, or events** 🎁  
- Place them to farm mobs automatically 🧟  
- Stack multiple spawners together for maximum efficiency ⚡  

💡 **Why They’re Valuable**  
Spawners are the backbone of advanced farming. From XP to rare drops, they provide the fuel for both your wallet and your progression.  

A single mob grinder can become a mega farm when you stack spawners — turning hard work into a steady stream of rewards.
