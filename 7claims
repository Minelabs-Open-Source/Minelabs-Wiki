# 🟢 Claims

**Bullet Points:**
- 🔨 Get a **golden shovel** from `/kit claim`  
- 📐 Right-click *two opposite corners* to create a protected zone  
- 📋 View claims: `/gptplist`  
- 🚪 Teleport to claims: `/gptp <id>`  
- 🤝 Share access: `/trust <player>`   

Claims keep your builds safe from griefing. Using a golden shovel (via /kit claim), you can mark out your land by selecting two opposite corners, creating a protected area that only you and trusted players can modify.

The claim system is highly versatile. You can view a list of all your claims using `/gptplist`, teleport directly to one with `/gptp <id>`, and even give building rights to friends using `/trust`. It’s the best way to secure your base and projects.
