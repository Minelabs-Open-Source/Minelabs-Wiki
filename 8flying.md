# ðŸ’— How to Fly

**Bullet Points:**
- Earn temporary flight from voting or AFK shop  
- Buy flight vouchers for `/fly` access  
- Activate flight with `/tfly` or `/fly`  
- Permanent flight comes with King rank and above  

Flight is a huge advantage for building, exploring, and grinding. Players can unlock it temporarily through AFK Tokens, voting rewards, or by buying flight vouchers.

For those who want permanent access, **King rank and higher grant unlimited flight**. This makes it a prestigious perk while still allowing casual players access through vouchers.
