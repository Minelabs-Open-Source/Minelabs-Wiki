## Contribution Ethics
This repository is a community made effort directed by me, **EndArchitect117**, backed by the Minelabs staff team to give back to the community in terms of knowledge and englightment, we actively reward active contributors with special in-game rewards, and sometimes digital gifts.

We expect:
- Unique information that has never been seen before
- Actually useful information that could assist players in progressing easily
- Proper language
- Some knowledge of Github usage
- **Github Markdown and Docsify syntax knowledge is a must**
with that being said, low quality commits, false information, and misuse of this repository will prevent you from being able to commit to Minelabs projects' wiki and be put on a volunteering blacklist. (this includes applying for staff..)

New information helps everyone in the community.
