# 🟣 AFK Rewards

## 💤 How It Works
- Earn **AFK Tokens** by staying AFK  
- Tokens can be used in the **AFK Shop**  
- Rewards include money pouches, gems, flight vouchers, tags, and more  

## ⚡ Commands
- Start AFKing with: `/afk`  

## 📈 Why AFK?
AFK rewards let you gain progress even when you’re idle. By running `/afk`, you earn tokens simply for being online but not active — rewarding loyalty with steady progression.  

These tokens can then be spent in the AFK Shop, which offers valuable rewards like:
- 💰 Money pouches  
- 💎 Gems  
- ✈️ Temporary flight vouchers  
- 🏷️ Cosmetic tags  

It’s one of the easiest ways to gain useful resources passively.
