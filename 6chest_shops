# ðŸŸ  How to Create a Chest Shop

**Bullet Points:**
- ðŸ“¦ Place an item in a **container** (chest, barrel, etc.)  
- ðŸª§ Place a **sign** while crouching  
  - Line 1: *leave blank*  
  - Line 2: Amount to sell/buy  
  - Line 3: Price (`B` for buy, `S` for sell)  
  - Line 4: Use `?` to auto-detect the item  

Examples:  
- `S 50` â†’ Sell for 50  
- `B 100` â†’ Buy for 100  
- Combine shops: `S 50 : B 100`  

Chest shops allow you to trade directly with other players in a simple and automated way. Once you set up your shop, players can interact with the sign to buy from or sell to you.

The flexibility of the shop system means you can choose to sell items to players, buy items from them, or even set up both in one sign. Using the `?` symbol ensures the sign automatically detects the item inside, making setup quick and foolproof.
